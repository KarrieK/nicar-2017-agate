The spreadsheet of alligator harvests used in this tutorial is from the [Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission](http://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/managed/alligator/harvest/data-export/). It has been modified slightly to add a numeric size column and to remove an extra location column.

Thanks to [Eric Sagara](https://twitter.com/esagara) for tipping us off to this awesome dataset.
